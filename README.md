# nanosamfw – NotANOtherSamsungFirmware downloader

## 📦 Project Description
This project is more than just another Samsung firmware downloader — it's a Python package designed to be integrated into other tools and workflows.
At its core, it includes:
- A backend client for the **Samsung Firmware Update Service**
- A high-level API that simplifies firmware downloads by providing just the **Model**, **CSC**, and **IMEI**

Whether you're building automation scripts, desktop tools, or backend services, this package offers a clean and modular way to access Samsung firmware data programmatically.
